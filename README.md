**Car Price Prediction Project:**

- Objective: Developed a predictive model to estimate car prices based on various features using Python and machine learning techniques.

- Key Contributions:
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between variables.
  - Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, correcting spelling errors, and creating new features such as fuel economy and car range.
  - Utilized statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, to build predictive models.
  - Implemented feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most significant variables for price prediction.
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), achieving an R-squared value of 0.899 on the test dataset.
  - Documented the entire project, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model building, and evaluation, for reproducibility and future reference.
  
- **Technologies** Used:Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Statsmodels

- Outcome: Successfully created a robust predictive model that can assist a car company in understanding the factors influencing car prices and making informed business decisions.
